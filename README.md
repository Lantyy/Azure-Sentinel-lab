# Azure-Sentinel-lab

# This Project
This is a instructional step by step process to building a functional **Azure Sentinel lab** for defensive security acting as a honey pot.

My purpose for this lab is to learn more about Security Monitoring and Detection Engineering.

# Virtual Machines / Tools
This lab consists of:

  ~ **Windows 10** This windows machine will be made vulnerable acting as a honey pot.
  
  ~ **Log Analytics Workspace** This will be the log repository used to ingest logs from the Windows VM.
	
  ~ **Azure Sentinel** This is a SIEM used to display & map the attacker data on a geographic world map.
